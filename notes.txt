error handling, error case set display message
greeting issue giving fail response
only 1 cite possible, multiple cites didn't design
2 word tags for differentiation bw similar canonical headings
ideally, only the most relevant (as min as possible) number of tags should be sent to gemini
frequency count of tags to decide which aspect more important
priority can be given to tags

not well optimized i feel as tags are manually written, limited
no bounds to natural language,
needs proper context handling
can be easily achieved through gemini bu 1 extra call make it costly and slow

spacy to process query and find token combinations

pymupdf didn't work
converted pdf into bytecode manually using OCR
use OCR for image based - > text based pdf for efficient PyMuPDF

expecting static content
structure fixed of pdfs
manual mapping, hardcoded keywords
