Itinerary Mini-Bot (Delivery/Ops)

Goal: Answer 10 fixed FAQs for a single booking (hotel address, check-in/out, pickup time, baggage rule link) using the booking’s PDF + a small FAQ file.

Why it’s intern-friendly: Tiny RAG without vector DB complexity.

Stack:

Python + PyMuPDF for text extraction

OpenAI for answer synthesis (prompt constrained to supplied text)

Simple /ask?booking_id=…&q=… API + minimal web chat

How it works:

Upload one itinerary PDF → extract & cache plaintext.

For a query, search the cached text with keyword windows.

Send only the matched snippets + policy FAQ to GPT; return answer with quoted citation.

Demo script (5 mins): Upload 1 PDF → ask 5 questions → see exact snippet used.

Success: ≥95% answers include a citation; p95 latency <1.5s; zero answers without evidence.

Guardrails: If no match → “I don’t see this in your itinerary—contact support,” with link. Redact PNR/passport patterns.
